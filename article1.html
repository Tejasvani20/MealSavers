        India is among the largest producers of these agricultural commodities, 
        <br>yet millions are still starving in the worldâ€™s most populous country.
        <br>India has been ranked 111 among 125 countries in the Global Hunger 
        <br>Index report released by two European agencies on October 12, 2023. 
        <br>India slipped four positions as compared to last year.
         
        <br>Further according to the report 34.7% of the children
        <br> aged under five in India are stunted (too short fortheir age),
        <br> while 20% suffer from wasting, meaning their weight is too low 
        <br>for their height. Malnourished  children have a higher risk of 
        <br>death from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea, pneumonia, and
        malaria.
