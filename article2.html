            India is the largest contributor of undernourished people in the world 
            (<br>Worldometer), with around 194.4 Million people, or 14.37% of its population 
            not <br>receiving enough nutrition.India has one of the worst rates of child malnutrition 
            <br>in the world, with one third of malnourished children globally being Indian. As per <br>the
             Government of India’s National Family Health Survey 5 (NFHS 5), ‘Thirty-six percent of 
             children under age five years are stunted; 19 percent are wasted; 32 percent are underweight;
            and 3 percent are overweight. Children born to mothers with no schooling and children in the 
            lowest wealth quintile are most likely to be undernourished’.
